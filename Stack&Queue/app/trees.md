# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
### There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

## 1. Depth-First

## 2. Breadth-First


### - Depth First: We can use a stack to build it.

+ Pre-order: root >> left >> right
+ In-order: left >> root >> right
+ Post-order: left >> right >> root


### - Breadth First: We can use Queue to build it

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
### Create a Node, Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree and build some method for it 

<br>


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
### Big(O) : 
+ space: O(n)
+ time: O(n)

## API
### Node: Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

### Binary Tree: Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
+ pre order
+ in order
+ post order 

### Binary Search Tree
+ Add Method: adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
+ Contains: indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
