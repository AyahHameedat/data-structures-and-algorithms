# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
### - Stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack but does not reference its previous.

+ Stacks follow these concepts: FILO, LIFO

+ Stack has some functionality (Push, Pop) and how to build it from scratch.


### - The queue is a data structure too.

+ queue follow these concepts: FILO, LILO
+ queue has some functionality (enqueue, dequeue) and how to build it from scratch.


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
## Create (POP, PUSH, Empty, Peek) methods for stack from scratch.
## Create (Enqueue, Dequeue, Empty, Peek) methods for Queue from scratch too.


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

### Big(O) -> O(1)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->
